detected_points	Boundary point detected
frontiers		The boundary points received by the filter, the data are the same as above
centroids		The effective boundary point after filtering
global_detector_shapes	Global tree
local_detector_shapes	Local tree
// with the Publish Point tool of RVIZ, set four boundary points of the growth tree clockwise or counterclockwise, and a starting point of the growth tree (as close as possible to the starting point of the robot). After setting, the robot will explore the map based on the growth tree.

11.Wheeltec App for Graphic Transfer, Mapping and Navigation
